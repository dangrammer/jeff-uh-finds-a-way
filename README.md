Jeff, uh, Finds a Way is a fan forum for none other than the eccentric, enigmatic Jeff Goldblum. Fan posts can be publically viewed as a chronological thread or browsed by category. Users can create a secure profile to create their own posts and comment on posts by other users. This is a project application done for module 2 of Flatiron School. Additional features, refactors, bug squashes, and enhanced styling are future goals.
